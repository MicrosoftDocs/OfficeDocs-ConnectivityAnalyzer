# Open Relay Detected



_**Topic Last Modified:** 2009-08-18_

The Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer attempts to send a test message using a recipient address that does not belong to the Exchange organization. If this operation succeeds, then the SMTP Server operates as an open relay and the following message is returned from the test.

"Open relay test message delivered successfully to Admin@TestExchangeConnectivity.com"

A computer that is running Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server, Exchange Server 2003 or Exchange Server 2007 can be configured as a mail relay, which is not recommended.

An Exchange computer that is configured as an open mail relay may be used to send unsolicited commercial e-mail, also known as spam. If other mail servers identify your Exchange computer as an unsolicited commercial e-mail server, then your Exchange computer may be added to block lists.
