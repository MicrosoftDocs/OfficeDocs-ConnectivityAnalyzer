The Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer includes the **I can’t send or receive email from Outlook (Office 365 only)** test.

This test verifies the Domain Name Server (DNS) records in your Office 365 domain to ensure that they are configured correctly for mail flow. If the DNS records are not configured correctly, mail flow will not function.

<div>

## More Information

To make sure that your DNS records are configured correctly, we recommend that you perform the following tasks:

  - Make sure that the domain you are testing is added to the Office 365 Admin Portal. For more information, see [Options for adding your domain to Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=285340).

  - Make sure that the domain has been verified by your Office 365 administrator. For more information, see [Verify your domain and change name servers](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=285342).

The Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer is a new tool that has limited documentation at this time. In an effort to improve the documentation for each of the errors you might receive, we would like to solicit additional information from the community. Please use the Community Content section below to post additional reasons about why your testing failed at this point. If you need technical assistance, please create a post in the appropriate [Exchange TechNet forum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=73420) or contact [Microsoft Support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=8158).
