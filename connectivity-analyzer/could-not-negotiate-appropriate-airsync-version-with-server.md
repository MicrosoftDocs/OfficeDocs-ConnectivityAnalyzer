# Could Not Negotiate an Appropriate Airsync Version with Server


_**Topic Last Modified:** 2009-08-18_

The Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer sends an HTTP request using the OPTIONS verb to the Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync virtual directory on the server and analyzes the HTTP headers in the HTTP response. If the MS-ASProtocolVersions header does not contain 2.5 or 12.0, then the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool generates the following error:

"Could not negotiate an appropriate Airsync version with server."

## For More Information

The Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer currently supports Exchange ActiveSync protocol versions 2.5 and 12.0. If you are using Exchange Server 2003 SP1 or earlier, then this error does not necessarily indicate a problem. Rather, it simply indicates that the tool is not able to properly test your server. Upgrade to Exchange Sever 2003 Service Pack 2 to get the ActiveSync v2.5 functionality.

The Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer has limited documentation at this time.
