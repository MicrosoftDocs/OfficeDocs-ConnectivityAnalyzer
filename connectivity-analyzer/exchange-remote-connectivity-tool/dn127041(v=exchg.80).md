The Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer includes the **I can’t log on to Lync on my mobile device or the Lync Windows Store App** test.

This test verifies the Domain Name Server (DNS) records for your on-premises domain to ensure they’re configured correctly to support Mobile Lync clients. This test also connects to the Autodiscover web service to ensure that the authentication, certificate, and web service for Mobility is correctly set up.

## More Information

To make sure that the DNS records and Autodiscover service are configured correctly, we recommend that you review the following requirement resources:

  - [Lync Windows Store App Requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=285338)

  - [Lync TechCenter: Lync Server for IT pros](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=285339)

The Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer is a new tool that has limited documentation at this time. In an effort to improve the documentation for each of the errors you might receive, we would like to solicit additional information from the community. Please use the following Community Content section to post additional reasons about why your testing failed at this point. If you need technical assistance, please create a post in the appropriate [Exchange TechNet forum](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=73420) or contact [Microsoft Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=8158).
