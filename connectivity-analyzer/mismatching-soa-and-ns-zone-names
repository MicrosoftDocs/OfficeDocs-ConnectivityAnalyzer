# SOA Record Zone Name for a parent zone while domain has separate NS record(s) delegation configured

A sub-domain is delegated through name server (NS) records at the domain registrar but the  target server actually hosts only the parent domain i.e. no Start of Authority (SOA) record is present for the sub-domain. This results in an SOA record returned which has the zone name of the parent domain (example below). This can cause EDNS resolvers like Windows DNS to fail resolving a MX query for the domain with a "ServerFailure" error.

For any of your domains or sub-domains configured as a separate DNS zone, each DNS zone should have an NS record and an SOA record for that zone, as stated in the RFC  (see RFC 1034 section 4.2.1, and RFC 2308 section 3).  

For example, if your parent domain is contoso.com, at your domain registrar (or parent zone server on-premises) you might have configured dedicated delegation for a sub-domain record for mail.contoso.com, like this: 


DNS Name		TTL		Type	Name Server 

mail.contoso.com	300	IN 	NS	ns1.contoso.com 

mail.contoso.com	300	IN	NS	ns2.contoso.com 

 

Yet, the final response for the MX query for mail.contoso.com returns an SOA record for contoso.com instead: 
 

contoso.com.	60	IN	SOA	ns1.contoso.com. hostmaster.ns1.contoso.com 2020090310 10800 3600 604800 60 

 

The different names on NS and SOA records causes EDNS to fail the query with ServerFailure as it violates the RFC references below. 

This is because ns1.contoso.com hosts only the parent domain, contoso.com (i.e. only contoso.com is listed in the zone file).  

One way to address the issue is to remove the dedicated delegation entries for the sub-domain mail.contoso.com from the domain's DNS records at the domain registrar and instead make an entry for the sub-domain A record itself in the parent domain zone (e.g. for *.contoso.com): 
 

Domain			TTL		Type	Name Server 

contoso.com		300	IN	NS	ns1.contoso.com. 

ns1.contoso.com	300	IN	A	1.2.3.4 

mail.contoso.com	300	IN	A	111.22.3.4 

 
If you have business needs that require you to host the sub-domain on separate servers from where the parent domain is hosted, then those servers should only list the sub-domain, mail.contoso.com in the zone file, and the sub-domain should have its own NS and SOA records (configured at the domain registrar).

	“The RRs that describe cuts around the bottom of the zone are NS RRs that name the servers for the subzones.  Since the cuts are between nodes, these RRs are NOT part of the authoritative data of the zone, and should be exactly the same as the corresponding RRs in the top node of the subzone”

<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2308#section-3">RFC 2308</a> specifies that SOA for the zone should be included into NO DATA response:
	Negative Answers from Authoritative Servers
	 
	   Name servers authoritative for a zone MUST include the SOA record of
	   the zone in the authority section of the response when reporting an
	   NXDOMAIN or indicating that no data of the requested type exists.
