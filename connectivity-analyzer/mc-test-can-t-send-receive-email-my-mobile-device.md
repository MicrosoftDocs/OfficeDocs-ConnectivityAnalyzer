# MCA test: I can't send or receive email on my mobile device


_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-11-12_

A Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer Tool test is run when the user selects the “I can’t send or receive email on my mobile device” option on a mobile device. This test is used to identify connectivity issues between mobile clients and a server that is running Microsoft Exchange Server. This test simulates the steps that a mobile device uses to obtain settings from the Exchange Autodiscover service and then connect to an Exchange server by using Exchange ActiveSync.
