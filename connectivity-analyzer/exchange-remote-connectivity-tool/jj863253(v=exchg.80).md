When you use the Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer Tool test suite to troubleshoot issues that affect sending or receiving email on a mobile device, the tool verifies connectivity to Microsoft Exchange Server. If the client can successfully connect to the Exchange server, the client has passed the test. However, if the client fails the test, you receive the following error message from the Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer: “The email server is not available.” This error occurs because the email service is not configured correctly or is not responding.

This issue must be resolved by an IT administrator. For more information about how to resolve this issue, administrators can refer to the following Microsoft TechNet topic: [RPC Server Unavailable Error was Thrown by the RPC Runtime](dd439392\(v=exchg.80\).md).
