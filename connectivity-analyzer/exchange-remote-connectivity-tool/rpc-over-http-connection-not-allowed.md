The Microsoft Exchange Analyzer tool attempts to log on to the Information Store using RPC over HTTP. If the error returned by the information store is ecRpcHttpDisallowed, then the Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool returns the following error.

"RPC/HTTP connections for this client are prohibited"

## For More Information

The error generated by Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer isn't necessarily indicative of a problem. Prohibiting clients from connecting using RPC over HTTP is a legitimate configuration option. However, if you ran Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer because you have Outlook clients who are unable to successfully connect using RPC over HTTP or Outlook Anywhere, then you will need to modify the setting that prohibits clients from connecting using this method.

To determine whether RPC over HTTP or Outlook Anywhere is enabled for your Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010 mailbox, run the following command from the Exchange Management Shell:

`Get-CASMailbox MailboxName | FL MAPIBlockOutlookRpcHTTP`

If the command returns $true, then you must enable Outlook Anywhere for the Exchange 2007 mailbox by using the following command:

`Set-CASMailbox MailboxName -MAPIBlockOutlookRpcHTTP:$false  `

For more information, see [When You Use Outlook With an Exchange 2007 Mailbox, You Cannot Connect to Exchange 2007, and You Receive an Error Message](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=100100).

The Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer is a new tool with limited documentation at this time. In an effort to improve the documentation for each of the errors you might receive, we would like to solicit additional information from the community. Please use the Community Content section below to post additional reasons why you failed at this point. If you need technical assistance, please create a post in the appropriate [Exchange TechNet forum](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=73420) or contact [support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=8158).
