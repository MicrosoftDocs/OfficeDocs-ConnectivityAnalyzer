When you use the Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer test suite to troubleshoot issues that affects sending or receiving email on a mobile device, the tool tries to log on to a specified user’s mailbox by using the user name that you provide. If the user name is not found, you receive the following error message from the Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer: “The user name provided could not be matched to a name in the email server's address list. Please check that you are using the correct user name.”

This error occurs if part of the user name that you provide is incorrect. This error may also occur if the user’s mailbox is misconfigured.
