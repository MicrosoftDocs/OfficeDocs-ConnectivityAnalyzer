The Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer Tool includes the “I can’t log on with Office Outlook” test. This test is a suite of tools that identify connectivity issues between email clients and a server that is running Microsoft Exchange Server. The test shows you the steps that Outlook takes to connect through Outlook Anywhere (RPC over HTTP). The test also shows you the steps that Outlook 2007 takes to obtain settings from the Autodiscover service.

## Office 365

If you want to include tests that are specific to mailboxes hosted in Office 365, select the check box for Microsoft Office 365 users. Additionally, if you want the tool to validate whether the user can log on to Office 365 by using on-premises credentials, select the check box for Office 365 users who are using the Single Sign On feature. This test also validates basic Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) configuration.
